Corruption function:
randomly choose a kernel size from a given range, and blur the given image
with the chosen kernel - this will imitate the bluring we get when upscaling
an image.
In each iteration, we extract patches from the original image and the blured
image, so the net will learn how to deblur a given image (not a motion blur)

Restore_image:
we add a wrapper function to the restore_image that gets an image and the required new resolution.
the function performs upscaling to the new size (which will cause bluring to the new image)
and send the new image to restore_image. the net already learn how to deal with the blured image
and will deblur the image.
