Here is another frequencies filtering. For too small window we let all the details remain in
both images, which cause us to see all the edges as we let the high frequencies stay, so the
blending is of course not good enough.
For too big window, on the other hand, we creating a strict low pass filter, which will also
cause us to get only very blur details, like the average of the images.
A normal size window will give us the correct implementation and blending.
