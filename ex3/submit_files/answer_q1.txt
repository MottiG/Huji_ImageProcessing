As we learn in class, laplacian pyramids can use as a band-pass-filter.
By multiplying each level with some coefficient, we actually applying the BPF.
For example, multiplying the smallest level by 0 will filter the low frequencies, 
in another words - LPF. multiplying the biggest one by zero will give us HPF. and any
other level and coefficients combining a BPF.
