Here again, as we geting higher and higher in the pyramid, we get better
images. Once again, since the levels are BPF, the lowest level will give
us very bright image with poor blending, since we still have most of the 
details of each image. 
when we get to the next levels more and more tiny details are desapire 
due to the LPF, and we get better blending.
