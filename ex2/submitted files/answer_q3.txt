If we are using boundaries='wrap' in the convolution, we get (almost) the same results,
since the convolution will use g (the kernel) as periodic, like fourier. 
If not, we will get slightly different results (black boundaries in the spatial) due to 
the fact that the boundaries are not treated with the same method and the convolution fills
the boundaries with zero.
