We didn't shift the input image, so the center is (0,0). but, we build the 
kernel with center in the middle (and zeros around). so trying to multiply the image
and the kernel without inverse-shifting the kernel, doesn't make any sense and will 
produce a corrupted image (4 different slices of the image, in 4 directions). 
When we inverse-shifting the kernel we change its center to be
also in (0,0) so the multiplication is correct.
